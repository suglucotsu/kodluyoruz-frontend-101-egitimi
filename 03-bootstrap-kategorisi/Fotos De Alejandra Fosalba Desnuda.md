The landmark Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade in 1973 legalized abortion in the United States and had a profound impact on the adoption landscape. Before the ruling, many unmarried pregnant white women felt pressured or coerced to give up their babies for adoption, as abortion was not a legal or safe option. In 1972, the year before Roe v. Wade, nearly one in five of these women chose to relinquish their babies for adoption. However, after the ruling, the availability and accessibility of abortion gave these women more choices and control over their reproductive decisions. As a result, the rate of infant relinquishment among unmarried pregnant white women plummeted to around 1 percent by the late 1990s. On the other hand, infant relinquishment rates among never-married Black women have been virtually nonexistent for decades, due to different cultural and historical factors that influenced their attitudes and preferences toward adoption.

The decline in infant relinquishment among unmarried pregnant white women also coincided with a rise in the number of children entering and exiting foster care in the United States. According to the \*\*Trends in Foster Care and Adoption: FY 2012 â 2021\*\* report by the \*\*U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\*\*, the number of children in foster care increased by 12 percent from 397,000 in 2012 to 443,000 in 2017, before decreasing slightly to 424,000 in 2021. The number of children adopted from foster care also increased by 35 percent from 50,000 in 2012 to 67,000 in 2021. These trends reflect the complex and dynamic factors that affect the supply and demand of adoptable children, such as changes in child welfare policies, practices, and funding; shifts in social norms and attitudes toward adoption; and variations in demographic and economic conditions.
  
Another notable trend in the adoption landscape is the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of adopted children and their families. The \*\*Multiethnic Placement Act (MEPA)\*\* of 1994 and its amendments in 1996 prohibited discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in foster care and adoption placements, and required states to recruit more diverse foster and adoptive parents. According to a report by the \*\*U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\*\*, the percentage of transracial adoptions (adoptions involving parents and children of different races) increased from 17 percent in 2005â2007 to 28 percent in 2017â2019. The report also found that the percentage of Black children adopted by White parents increased from 26 percent to 35 percent, while the percentage of Hispanic children adopted by White parents increased from 12 percent to 18 percent during the same period. These trends indicate that MEPA has had some positive effects on reducing racial barriers and increasing opportunities for permanency for children of color in foster care.
  
However, despite the legal and social changes that have shaped the adoption landscape in the United States over the past decades, there are still many challenges and gaps that need to be addressed. For instance, there are still more children waiting for adoption than there are adoptive families available. According to the \*\*Child Welfare Information Gateway\*\*, an estimated 122,000 children were waiting for adoption as of September 30, 2019. Moreover, some groups of children face more difficulties and delays in finding permanent homes than others, such as older children, sibling groups, children with special needs, and children of color. Additionally, there are still issues related to the quality and availability of post-adoption services and supports for adoptive families, especially those who adopt children with complex histories of trauma, abuse, or neglect. Therefore, more research, advocacy, and collaboration are needed to improve the outcomes and experiences of all parties involved in adoption.
